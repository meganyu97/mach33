often times i retreat into my thoughts 
my nostalgia for memories lost
my frustration with the international state of affairs
my vexation with my own state of affairs
my desire for experiences seemingly so far from reach
and i wish i could solve the equation
that would give me the mach 33 of life
so i can break free of everything holding me down
and never look back.
